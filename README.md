# hello-world

We all have to start somewhere.

Dear Reader,

Welcome to the beginning of what I hope to be an exciting dive into the world of programming. I completed a Bachelor's Degree with a major in Finance and have since decided to transition into something I think will be a little more creative.
I played and composed heavy metal music in a band for several years.
I enjoy reading, working out and playing both video and board games.

By the time you have read this, hopefully I have an interesting project you can either learn from or help me improve.

Cheers,

Dave
